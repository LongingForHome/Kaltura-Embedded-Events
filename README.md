# ðŸŽ¬ Kaltura Embedded Events
A developer-focused guide to integrating __Kaltura Embedded Events__ into your own websites and applications.  
This repository provides __reference guides, code samples, and visuals__ that illustrate the flows and components of building Kaltura Events functionality into your sites.


## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Kaltura provides a rich experience and feature set as part of their Events offering, supporting large scale live broadcasts, smaller panel-style or interactive webinars, and web-based broadcast studios.  There is also a robust set of interactions available to attendees including chat, Q&A, polls, rating scales, quizzes, word clouds, surveys, emoji reactions, and more.  On top of that Kaltura offers the flexibility to customize and control the experience with your own branding, theme controls, and/or full CSS.

This guide will cover two main topics:
* The creation of the various event types supported in Kaltura.  This can be done inside Kaltura applications, but also via API, which we will discuss.
* The authentication of users and rendering of the embedded event iframe for your site/application


## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
* A Kaltura account with a KAFTestMe instance and all events features enabled.
  * The KAFTestMe offers a simple and flexible endpoint to allow the loading of the full session experience within a simple, easy to use iframe.
* An admin appToken for accessing the Kaltura API.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started
There are a few concepts and terms we should understand before getting started:
* __Webcast session__ - this is different from a regular live stream.  A Webcast entails a live entry, but also scheduling components for when the stream will start and end.  A Webcast also enables the ability to access the Webcast studio, allowing addition of slides and other storyboard components, as well as a mini monitoring console.  Webcast sessions are most commonly driven from a hardware or software encoder broadcasting RTMP(S) or SRT into Kaltura.  Attendees of these sessions watch the stream via the Kaltura video player.
* __Interactive/Webinar session__ - this is basically a WebRTC meeting room, with two different modes:  
  * In an Interactive session, everyone will join the room with cams/mics "on stage" so that everyone can interact with each other in real time.  These sessions are great for things like sponsor booths, demo rooms, interactive trainings, breakouts, virtual classrooms, and more.
  * In a Webinar session, it is the same room experience with the exception that only speakers and moderators can initially join the meeting with cam/mic "on stage" while all other attendees join in a listen mode (no cam/mic) "off stage" (however, they can still raise hand or request to join, and a moderator can allow them to activate cam/mic and join the stage).  These session types are better suited to presentation sessions where the presenters are delivering content to many but don't need it to be fully interactive with every attendee, while still having the flexibility to bring people on stage where they can be seen/heard.
* __Webcast Studio session__ - this is a combination of the former two.  For speakers and moderators, there is a WebRTC meeting room with features such as a green room for stage management, storyboard for organizing a run-of-show, and other tools, allowing the creation of a customized, high production-level event.  The room then also has controls for allowing what is being produced in the room to then be broadcast out to a Webcast session, where attendees will be able to watch the session through the Kaltura video player.  This allows basically unlimited scale in the number of attendees that are able to join the session.
* __Simulive, or Pre-recorded, session__ - this session type is basically like a Webcast session, but instead of having to have an encoder broadcast the stream, you can use a pre-recorded video asset and have it stream 'live' at a prescribed date and time.  This offloads the pressure and risk of a live production and allows you to deliver the highest quality post-produced and edited content while still leveraging the social aspects of a live event.

All of the above session types still allow everyone to participate in the Chat and Collaboration (CNC) features (mentioned above in the overview).



see https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/VPaaS-API-Getting-Started/Getting-Started-VPaaS-API.html for guides and general reference on using the Kaltura API, including access to [Client Libraries in a number of languages](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Client_Libraries).

Kaltura strongly encourages the [use of appTokens for authenticating to the API.](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/VPaaS-API-Getting-Started/application-tokens.html)

# Basic Workflow
![Sequence diagram outlining the Vendor to Kaltura API interaction flow](resources/Vendor-REACH-Flow.png)

# Workflow Description
The general flow implemented by a vendor would follow this outline:
1. Connect to Kaltura API and establish a valid session
2. Call [entryVendorTask.getJobs()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/getJobs) to get a list of jobs that have been submitted by any customer users for your services
3. Loop through the job objects in the response and get additional job details with [entryVendorTask.get()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/get)
4. Retrieve the asset related using details from [baseEntry.getPlaybackContext()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/baseEntry/action/getPlaybackContext) and the [playManifest API](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Deliver-and-Distribute-Media/playManifest-streaming-api.html)
5. Update the job status to PROCESSING using [entryVendorTask.updateJob()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/updateJob)
6. Process the requested job in the vendor backend/app.  Upon job completion on the vendor side, use the partnerId and accessKey (from the job request object) to add the generated assets (ex: captions, transcript, chapters, etc) to the requested media in the customer account
7. Update the job status to READY using [entryVendorTask.updateJob()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/updateJob)

## Workflow step details and notes
1. Connect to the Kaltura API using your Vendor account.  The Kaltura Partners team can provide you with this account and the relevant details.  We strongly suggest provisioning an appToken for this account and using that to spawn your API sessions. See [Getting started with application tokens](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/VPaaS-API-Getting-Started/application-tokens.html) for more information on appToken sessions.  Also, you can find [pre-compiled Kaltura API client libraries in a number of languages](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Client_Libraries) to help you get started.
   - The client lib exposes the ability to define a Client Tag for each API request. This property is used later by Kaltura to track which application issued which call. With REACH we make another use of this field. To ensure Kaltura has a way to determine the Task processing E2E, the vendor should follow the following standards:
     - For non task-specific API calls, the client tag should be set to be '<default clientTag>_vendorName-vendorPartnerId'. (default clientTag consists of the client library programming language and the library build date) . Example: 'php5:18-11-11_vendorName_12345'
     - For task-specific API calls, the Task ID should also be added to the clientTag: Example, for PHP5 client library, Task ID (9292) and vendor account id (12345), the resulting client tag should be "php5:18-11-11_vendorName-12345-9292"
   - The appToken should be set with 'disableentitlement' privilege.  The default expiry is 24 hours, but can be set as desired.
2. Once you have a valid client session established, make a call to [entryVendorTask.getJobs()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/getJobs).  This will return a list of requested jobs for your Vendor account.  Make sure to use the following parameters in your request:
   - entryVendorTaskFilter->vendorPartnerIdEqual - set this parameter to be the vendor partner ID (should be the same value for all tasks)
   - entryVendorTaskFilter->statusEqual = PENDING - this will only return a list of tasks that are PENDING processing by the vendor.
   - depending on the number of tasks, you may need to use the pager object to paginate results
3. Once you have the full list of tasks, then you'll need to connect to each customer account to retrieve additional details about the request (custom dictionaries, whether or not to set the captions to auto-display, etc).  To do so, you'll loop through the list of tasks and make a call to [entryVendorTask.get()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/get).  When making this call, you'll need to supply the following parameters:
   - id - this is the task id and will have been included in the task object from the entryVendorTask.getJobs() call.
   - ks - this is a global parameter in the API client.  For this call, you'll need to change your client KS (Kaltura Session) to match the accessKey returned in the task object.  This KS is associated to the specific customer account and media related to the originating task request.  This value will change with each task you are looping through, so be sure to set it accordingly for each task.
   - responseProfile - this is also a global parameter in the API client.  The object type should be ResponseProfileHolder, and you should set the systemName attribute value to 'reach_vendor'.  This tells the API to return additional information related to the Customer's REACH profile such as dictionaries, processing region, caption display settings, and other pertinent details.  This will UNSET after each API call, so it will need to be reset for each subsequent call, much like the KS.
4. Depending on if the job request is for VOD or Live assets, then our next step will vary.
   * For VOD, once you have the task details, you'll need to get the media for the specified request.  You'll have the option to download the needed flavor (transcoded rendition), or obtain an HLS manifest to allow you to stream the file (audio, video, or both) and concatenate the segments on your end to rebuild them into a file.  To do so, maintain the specific KS for the task, and make a call to [baseEntry.getPlaybackContext()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/baseEntry/action/getPlaybackContext). 
       - Supply the following parameters:
         - ks - ensure that the KS matches the accessKey from the original task request.
         - entryId - this id will have been supplied in the original task request.
         - contextDataParams->objectType = KalturaPlaybackContextOptions
         - contextDataParams->streamerType = "http" if you want the downloadable file, or "applehttp" if you want HLS manifest(s).
         - contextDataParams->ks = the ks, or accessKey, from the original task object
       - Based on the response from the above call, you should have the needed information to get the needed media.  See [information on the playManifest API](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Deliver-and-Distribute-Media/playManifest-streaming-api.html) for details on constructing stream or download urls for the media. Be sure to include the customer partnerId and ks (accessKey) that were provided in the original request task object.
         - if you wish to ultilize HLS and only retrieve the audio track, or just the video track, see [url path parameters](https://github.com/kaltura/nginx-vod-module#url-path-parameters) for details.
   * For live, you should have a 'scheduleEventId' that comes in the entryVendorTask details, along with the scheduled start and end times for the live event.  After provisioning your services for the live session, you should call [scheduleEvent.updateLiveFeature()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/scheduleEvent/action/updateLiveFeature) to provide the following data back to Kaltura:
       - mediaUrl and mediaKey - an RTMP(S) stream ingest url and key where Kaltura should relay the live stream to you.
       - captionUrl and captionToken - a websocket address and token where Kaltura should connect at the scheduled event time to receive caption data from you over a realtime websocket.
       - see [Creating Assets](resources/Creating_Assets.md) for more information.
5. Once you have the media or stream and begin to process the task, you'll need to update the task status.  To do so, call the [entryVendorTask.updateJob()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/updateJob) endpoint.  For normal scenarios, you'll update the job with the following:
   - status = PROCESSING .  For live jobs that will be executed at a future scheduled date, set the status = SCHEDULED upon provisioning the job, then update the task again to status = PROCESSING when you begin to process the task.
   - ks - make sure the set your KS back to your vendor KS that was generated with your vendor appToken when your polling process began.
6. Upon completion of processing the request on the vendor side, you'll need to update the entry in Kaltura with the relevant generated assets (caption, transcript, chapters, audio description track, etc).  Depending on the service requested and the generated output, you may need to use additional methods to create things like captions, transcripts, chapters, additional audio tracks, etc:
   - see [Creating Assets](resources/Creating_Assets.md) for more information.
   - For all calls, be sure to use the accessKey (ks), partnerId, and entryId that were specified in the original task object.  In addition, some object types may need reference to other objects (like captionAsset has a parameter for reference to the transcript (attachmentAsset), so be sure to supply those where needed.  If you have additional questions, feel free to ask the Kaltura Partners team for added guidance.
7. After adding the requested assets to the entry, update the job status again using [entryVendorTask.updateJob()](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/service/entryVendorTask/action/updateJob).
   - be sure to reset the ks back to your vendor ks.
   - on success, set the 'status' to 'READY', and the outputObjectId to the id  returned for the asset you created (if multiple, just use the first or most prominent)
   - for any kind of error encountered, set the 'status' to 'ERROR', and use the 'errDescription' field to provide more details on the error.
   - use the 'externalTaskId' parameter to store any relevant task processing identifiers in your system.  This will help if we ever need to track a task back to you to troubleshoot or provide additional information.
 
## ðŸ§© Additional Information
In this guide we discussed the programmatic creation of the various types of event sessions, and what it looks like to render those sessions within your own applications.  The assumption up to this point is that each session would have it's own 'landing page' within your application.  However, KAF has a bonus feature of an endpoint that would allow for an entire list/agenda of sessions to be shown in a single view.  This can be useful if you want to simplify your site and not have to maintain the landing page wrapper for every session separately.

See [resources](resources) for more help.
